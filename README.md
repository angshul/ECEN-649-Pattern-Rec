# ECEN-649-Pattern-Rec
Viola Jones Algorithm

There are 5 Jupyter Notebooks (ipython) files. <br/>
AdaBoost-1,3,5-rounds<br/>
AdaBoost-10-rounds<br/>
Threshold<br/>
Cascading<br/>

Make sure python 3.6 is installed. Packages needed to run the files are mentioned in the report.
 Please change the data directory to the absolute path where the dataset folder is located as given below: <br/>

data_dir="C:\\Users\\ANGSHUL\\Downloads\\dataset" <br/>

Note: Extract the dataset folder from the zip/rar file and change the above path in the code to point to the dataset folder. 
I have assumed the zip/rar file has already been extracted and the dataset folder is present, hence there is no code to extract from the compressed folder. <br/>

It might take a considerable amount of time to train for 5 and 10 rounds.
